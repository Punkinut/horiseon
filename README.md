# Refactoring Horiseon

## What I did

This is the [Link] to the repository (https://github.com/Punkinut/horiseon) where I implemented all the changes needed to make the previous code semantic!

**Below** is a list of specific changes I made in order to complete this task.

> **HTML Clean Up**: I deleted most elements that were 'div' related and changed them to semantic ones. I also restructured the code by adding correct indentation. I commented on everything to make it more clear. I made sure that the HTML file linked correctly to the css file. The links in the navigation were also fixed and I deleted some classes that were not needed.

> **CSS Clean Up**: I deleted classes which repeated themselves and I combined them into one. I added descriptive comments onto each CSS element. I changed the structure so that it was more in line with the HTML structure. I also edited the content inside some CSS elements which were too complicated. I made some CSS visual changes to match the desired look of the webpage.

Beyond this, I just made it much more tidy. This includes things like alt tags for the images etc. Hope you enjoyed reading this file :)
